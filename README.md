Stock Market Prediction and Forecasting using Stacked LSTM
This project employs Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict stock prices based on historical data. LSTM networks are particularly effective for time series prediction tasks due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.

Overview
The stock market prediction and forecasting system utilize historical stock price data to train a predictive model. The model learns from patterns and trends in past stock prices to forecast future prices. This system aids investors and traders in making informed decisions by providing insights into potential market movements.

Implementation
The project is implemented using Python programming language with libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the LSTM model. The dataset consists of historical stock price data, typically including features such as opening price, closing price, high, low, and volume. After preprocessing the data and scaling it using MinMaxScaler, it is split into training and testing sets.

The LSTM model architecture comprises multiple LSTM layers stacked on top of each other, allowing the network to learn complex patterns in the data. During training, the model iteratively adjusts its parameters to minimize the prediction error. Once trained, the model can make predictions on unseen data.

Usage
To utilize the stock market prediction system, users can follow these steps:

Install the required dependencies: TensorFlow, Keras, pandas, numpy, etc.
Prepare the historical stock price data in a suitable format.
Train the LSTM model using the provided training data.
Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data.
Utilize the trained model to make predictions on new data.
Analyze the predictions to gain insights into potential market trends and make informed decisions.
Conclusion
Stock market prediction and forecasting using Stacked LSTM offer a valuable tool for investors and traders to anticipate market movements and optimize their trading strategies. By leveraging advanced deep learning techniques, this project aims to provide accurate and reliable predictions, aiding users in navigating the complex and dynamic world of financial markets.
